    rm "filename" - because the file is gone, gone, gone!
34. Why should I use version control? It allows wveryone on the team to work on the 
    project at the same time without stepping on each other's code. It tracks what 
    changes were made by whom, it also keeps the production copy of the code 
    clean while you try different solutions to problems / add in new features.
35. How often should I commit to github? Not based on time but on what you are coding.

Stretch Questions
1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? 
    Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width available. They cannot be
    nested within Inline elements, but they can be nested within other block elements. 
    Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much room as they need.
    They also do not disturb the document flow. They can be nested within both 
    other inline and block elements. 
2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? It comes 
    out of the normal document flow. It is positioned relative to its parent. This also
    affects other elements in the flow.
3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also 
have the ability to give it a width? Set display: inline-block; 
4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display 
    inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block: <div>, <section>, <p>
    inline: <a>, <img>
    inline-block: <button>
5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? The box model 
    forms the basis for how content flows on a webpage. All HTML elements are boxes.
    For CSS, the box model refers to the compoents that wrap around HTML elements.
    From outside-in the part are:
    margin (space between the box and content around it, transparent); 
    border (can be styled); 
    padding (space around the content, transparent); 
    content (where text, images, etc. appear).
    The problem with the Box Model is that, when you define width and/or heigth, any
    added paddingand/or border changes the size of the element. That makes it very 
    difficult when you are trying to place elements on a page. The solution is found
    in the box-sizing attribute. Seeting box-sizing to "border-box" forces any padding
    and/or border to be contained within the dimensions set by the width and heigth attributes.
